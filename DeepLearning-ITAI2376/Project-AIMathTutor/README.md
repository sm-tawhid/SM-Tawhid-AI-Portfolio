# AI Math Tutor – Rule-Based Algebra Assistant
**Course:** ITAI-2376 – Deep Learning  
**Student:** SM Tawhid  

---

## Project Overview
This project implements a lightweight AI Math Tutor capable of solving beginner algebra equations and generating practice quizzes.  
The system uses rule-based logic with symbolic algebra parsing to interpret and solve expressions such as:

- `x + 4 = 9`  
- `2x = 12`  
- `x - 3 = 5`

It also includes a quiz mode that generates random math questions and evaluates user answers.

## Key Features
- Solves single-variable linear equations  
- Supports user interaction via text prompts  
- Quiz mode with auto-grading  
- Real-time feedback and validation  
- Beginner-friendly AI agent design  

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10+  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- `sympy` for solving equations  
- `random` for quiz question generation  
- `re` for pattern matching and parsing

## How to Run
1. Open `AI_Math_Tutor_Agent.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab  
2. Run all cells from top to bottom  
3. At the prompt `"You:"`, type a math expression or choose quiz mode  
4. Type `"quit"` to exit the program

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how simple rule-based AI can be used to support learning environments.  
It provides a foundation for more advanced NLP or deep learning tutoring systems.
