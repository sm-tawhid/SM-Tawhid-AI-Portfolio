# ITAI-2376 – Deep Learning  
This course focused on the fundamentals of deep learning, neural networks, and intelligent agent design.  
We explored concepts such as activation functions, training loops, loss optimization, and the structure of learning systems.

In addition to neural-network concepts, the course also emphasized logic-based AI approaches and how rule-based systems connect to modern learning models.
