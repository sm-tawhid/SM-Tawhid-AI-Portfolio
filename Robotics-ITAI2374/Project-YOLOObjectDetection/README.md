# YOLO Object Detection – ITAI-2374
**Course:** ITAI-2374 – Robot Operating Systems & Platforms  
**Student:** SM Tawhid  

---

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates object detection using a pretrained YOLOv8 model.  
The notebook loads the model, performs inference on sample images, and visualizes bounding boxes with confidence scores.

This serves as an introduction to real-time object detection workflows commonly used in robotics, automation, and computer vision systems.
