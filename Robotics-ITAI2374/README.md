# ITAI-2374 – Robot Operating Systems & Platforms  
This course covered essential robotics concepts, including perception, kinematics, SLAM, and navigation.  
We learned how AI models integrate into robotic pipelines and explored object detection, mapping, and robot sensing.

Hands-on labs included working with ROS-based tools, SLAM simulations, Jetson hardware setup, and object detection workflows.

### Projects in This Course
- **YOLO Object Detection Demo** – Implemented pretrained YOLOv8 inference to detect objects and visualize bounding boxes.
