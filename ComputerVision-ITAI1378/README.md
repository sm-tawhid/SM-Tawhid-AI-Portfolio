# ITAI-1378 – Computer Vision & Artificial Intelligence  
This course introduced the foundations of computer vision, covering image processing, feature extraction, and modern deep learning–based vision methods.  

Throughout the semester, I worked with tools such as OpenCV and YOLOv8 to understand how machines interpret visual data.  
Key skills included image filtering, edge detection, object detection, and applying pretrained models to real-world tasks.

### Projects in This Course
- **License Plate Detector (YOLOv8)** – Trained an object detection model to locate license plates in vehicle images.
